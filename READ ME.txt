1) Use the FVC datasets
   -Generate fixed-length vector features using mcc and kernel learning-based kpca
   -Make sure mccsdk.dll file can be read by matlab

2) Perform vector perm and shift ordering
   -Run 'RandomHashCode_with_protection' to perform vector permutation and shift-ordering (achieve non-invertibility).
   -Simultaneously generate hash codes/templates.

3) Evaluations
   -Switch between different fingerprint impressions in 'similarity_cal' for performance analysis.
   -Switch between different parameters in 'RPermutedHashedCode' to perform analysis on the effect of different parameter tuning on the performance-security trade-offs.
